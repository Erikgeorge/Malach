           <h1>About Malach</h1>
           <div id="aboutContainer">
               <p>Malach was born on June 5th, 1999, 19 years before this site was actualized. <br> He was born to Karni Dorell and Doug Campbell, two Red Hook based artists. <br> He follows in their footsteps in some respects, as he is an accomplished visual artist in many mediums, be it drawing, collage, photography, or even Photoshop doodles. <br>In the 1st grade, Malach met probably the single greatest influence in his life (although that is a story for <a href="us.html">another page</a>). <br> Malach is: <ul>
                   <li>Funny</li><li>Quick-witted</li><li>Charismatic</li><li>Handsome</li>
                   <li>A Great Storyteller and Listener</li>
                   <li>Good at Making Mixes</li>
                   <li>A Good Drinking/Cooking Buddy</li>
                   <li>In All Actuality My Closest Friend</li>
                   <li>Kind of Shitty</li>
               </ul>
               All in all, he has come into his own in a lot of ways, and while he's made a lot of progress in his life from when I've first met him, he has a lot more to go through - college bullshit, romantic bullshit, miscellaneous uncategorized bullshit; either way, he's grown into someone I like to call my friend and plan to call so for as long as I can foresee.
