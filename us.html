               <p>Malach and I have seen many good times. Be it our first drunken New Years, our first rap song, our first prank call, our first video, our first prank call caught on video, our first birthday celebration, our first time going to AWE, our first time getting soup dumplings together, our first drunken cooking night, our first time making a movie together, our first time going to a party together, our first international trip together, our first phone call in college, our first class together, our first sleep over, our first lunch together, our first dinner together, our first stolen Facebook post, our first song suggestion one way or the other, our first time joking to each other ever (that would be a hard one to remember...), or any number of other things that could be brought up, Malach has been someone I've grown up with. He's a brother to me and I know my family sees him the same way. I hope there are many more firsts to come, and that we can meet them together, and that none of the firsts we share have a last. Love you bruhbruh... (Thought I should also mention Happy Birthday I guess)</p>
